<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>My partner, who is the author of these
short essays on Golf Course Architecture,
has asked me to write an introduction.
This is, however, hardly necessary, as the
name of Dr. Mackenzie is so well known
in connection with this subject.</p>

<p>Many years ago now the idea came to
him, as to a few others, that it might not
be impossible to create a golf course
without doing damage to the natural
attractions of the site. Up to that period
the courses which had been designed by
man, and not by nature, had in great
measure failed in this direction, and
although no doubt they had provided
necessary opportunities for playing the
game, the surroundings in many cases
proved a source of irritation rather than
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>I vividly remember meeting my present
partner for the first time. I had been
asked to go to Leeds to advise about the
design of the Alwoodley Golf Course, and
stayed at his house. After dinner he took
me into his consulting room, where, instead
of finding myself surrounded by the
weapons of his profession as a Doctor of
Medicine, I sat in the midst of a collection
of photographs of sand bunkers,
putting greens, and golf courses, and many
plans and designs of the Alwoodley Course.
I found that I was staying with a real
enthusiast, and one who had already
given close attention to a subject in which
I have always been interested.</p>

<p>And it is this enthusiasm for the natural
beauty of nature which has helped him
in all his work, so that in the case of Alwoodley
the player not only has the opportunity
of displaying his skill in the game,
but also of enjoying the relaxation which
delightful natural surroundings always give.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>No doubt many mistakes were made in
our early attempts, and I never visit a
course which I have designed without
seeing where improvements could be
made in the constructional work, and as
long as this is so, I feel that we shall all
continue to learn and to make progress,
our instructor being nature herself.</p>

<span class="smaller">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN
COURSE CONSTRUCTION AND GREEN-KEEPING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Economy in course construction consists
in obtaining the best possible results at a
minimum of cost. The more one sees of
golf courses, the more one realises the
importance of doing construction work
really well, so that it is likely to be of
a permanent character. It is impossible
to lay too much stress on the importance
of finality.</p>

<p>Every golfer knows examples of courses
which have been constructed and rearranged
over and over again, and the
fact that all over the country thousands
of pounds are frittered away in doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
bad work which will ultimately have to
be scrapped is particularly distressful to
a true economist. As an example of
unnecessary labour and expense, the writer
has in mind a green which has been
entirely relaid on four different occasions.
In the first instance, it was of the ridge
and furrow type; the turf was then
lifted and it was made dead flat. A new
secretary was appointed, and he made
it a more pronounced ridge and furrow
than ever; it was then relaid and made
flat again, and has now been entirely
reconstructed with undulations of a more
natural outline and appearance.</p>

<p>In discussing the question of finality,
it is well to inquire if there are any really
first-class courses in existence which have
been unaltered for a considerable number
of years and still remain, not only a
good test of golf, but a source of pleasure
to all classes of players. Is there any
existing course which not even the rubber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
cored ball has spoilt? And, if so, what
is the cause of its abiding popularity?
The only one I know of is one which has
been described as “a much-abused old
course at a little place called St. Andrews,
in the Kingdom of Fife.” This (as well
as some of the other championship courses
to a lesser extent) still retains its popularity
among all classes of amateurs. In
fact, it is characteristic of all the best
courses that they are just as pleasurable
(possibly even more so) to the long handicap
man as to the player of championship
rank. This fact knocks on the head
the argument which is often used that
the modern expert tries to spoil the
pleasure of the player by making courses
too difficult.</p>

<p>The successful negotiation of difficulties
is a source of pleasure to all classes of
players.</p>

<p>It may be asked, “Who originally
constructed St. Andrews?” Its origin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
appears to be shrouded in mystery:
like Topsy, in <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, it
simply “growed.” But the fact of the
matter is that St. Andrews differs from
others in that it has always been deemed
a sacrilege to interfere with its natural
beauties, and it has been left almost untouched
for centuries. No green-keeper has
ever dared to shave down its natural undulations.
Most of the bunkers have been left
where nature placed them, and others have
originated from the winds and the rains
enlarging divot marks left by the players,
and some of them possibly by the green-keepers
converting those hollows where
most players congregated, into bunkers,
owing to the difficulty of keeping them
free from divot marks. The bunkers at
St. Andrews are thus placed in positions
where players are most likely to go—in
fact, in the precise positions which the
ordinary Green Committee would suggest
should be filled up. This is a significant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
fact, and tends to show that many of
our existing ideas in regard to hazards
have been erroneous. Mr. John L. Low
pointed out years ago that no hazard
is unfair wherever it is placed, and this
particularly applies if the hazard is visible,
as it should be obvious that if a player
sees a hazard in front of him and promptly
planks his ball into it he has chosen the
wrong spot.</p>

<p>I once heard a Yorkshire tale of
an old farmer finding a man in his
coal-house during a recent coal strike.
He put his head through the window
and said, “Now I’ve copped you picking
out all the big lumps.” A voice from
the darkness came, “You’re a liar, I’m
taking them as they come.”</p>

<p>On the old type of course like St.
Andrews, the players have to take the
hazards as they come, and do their best
to avoid them.</p>

<p>There is nothing new about the ideas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of the so-called Golf Architect: he simply
wishes to reproduce the old ideas as
exemplified in the old natural courses
like St. Andrews, those courses which
were played on before over-zealous green
committees demolished the natural undulations
of the fairways and greens,
and made greens like lawns for croquet,
tennis, or anything else except golf, and
erected eyesores in the shape of straight
lines of cop bunkers, instead of emphasising
the natural curves of the
links.</p>

<p>In the old view of golf, there was no
main thoroughfare to the hole: the player
had to use his own judgment without
the aid of guide posts, or other adventitious
means of finding his way. St.
Andrews still retains the old traditions
of golf. For example, I have frequently
seen four individuals playing the long hole
(the fourteenth), and deliberately attacking
it in four different ways, and three out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of the four were probably right in playing
it in the ways they selected.</p>

<p>At St. Andrews “it needs a heid to
play gowf,” as the caddie said to the
professor.</p>

<p>As the truest economy consists in finality,
it is interesting to consider the essential
features of an ideal golf course. Some of
them are suggested now:</p>

<p>1. The course, where possible, should
be arranged in two loops of nine holes.</p>

<p>2. There should be a large proportion
of good two-shot holes, two or three
drive-and-pitch holes, and at least four
one-shot holes.</p>

<p>3. There should be little walking between
the greens and tees, and the course
should be arranged so that in the first
instance there is always a slight walk
forwards, from the green to the next tee;
then the holes are sufficiently elastic to
be lengthened in the future if necessary.</p>

<p>4. The greens and fairways should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
sufficiently undulating, but there should
be no hill climbing.</p>

<p>5. Every hole should have a different
character.</p>

<p>6. There should be a minimum of blindness
for the approach shots.</p>

<p>7. The course should have beautiful
surroundings, and all the artificial features
should have so natural an appearance
that a stranger is unable to distinguish
them from nature itself.</p>

<p>8. There should be a sufficient number
of heroic carries from the tee, but the
course should be arranged so that the
weaker player with the loss of a stroke
or portion of a stroke shall always
have an alternative route open to him.</p>

<p>9. There should be infinite variety in
the strokes required to play the various
holes—viz., interesting brassy shots, iron
shots, pitch and run-up shots.</p>

<p>10. There should be a complete absence
of the annoyance and irritation caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
by the necessity of searching for lost
balls.</p>

<p>11. The course should be so interesting
that even the plus man is constantly
stimulated to improve his game in attempting
shots he has hitherto been unable
to play.</p>

<p>12. The course should be so arranged
that the long handicap player, or even
the absolute beginner, should be able
to enjoy his round in spite of the fact
that he is piling up a big score.</p>

<p>13. The course should be equally good
during winter and summer, the texture
of the greens and fairways should be
perfect, and the approaches should have
the same consistency as the greens.</p>

<h3>A DECIDED ADVANTAGE</h3>

<p>In regard to the first three principles,
there can be little difference of opinion.
It is a considerable advantage that a course
should be arranged in two loops of nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
holes, as on a busy day players can
commence at either the first or tenth tee.</p>

<p>In regard to the fourth principle. It
used to be a common fallacy that greens
should be made dead flat. Even on some
of the best golf courses at the present
day you find them made like croquet
lawns. There has been somewhat of a
reaction lately against undulating greens,
but this, I believe, is entirely due to
the fact that the undulations have been
made of a wrong character, either
composed of finicky little humps or of
the ridge and furrow type. Natural undulations
are the exact opposite to the
artificial ridge and furrow. The latter
has a narrow hollow, and a broad ridge,
whereas the former has a large, bold,
sweeping hollow, and a narrow ridge.</p>

<p>The most interesting putting the writer
has ever seen is on the Ladies’ Putting
Course at St. Andrews. Even first-class
golfers consider it a privilege to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
invited there, and are to be found putting
with the greatest enthusiasm from
early morn till late at night. There the
undulations are of the boldest possible
type, large sweeping hollows rising abruptly
four or five feet up to small plateaus.
A modern golf architect who dared to
produce the boldness of these St. Andrews’
undulations could hardly hope to escape
hostile criticism.</p>

<p>In constructing natural-looking undulations
one should attempt to study the
manner in which those among the sand-dunes
are formed. These are fashioned by
the wind blowing up the sand in the form
of waves, which become gradually turfed
over in the course of time. Natural undulations
are, therefore, of a similar shape
to the waves one sees by the seashore,
and are of all kinds of shapes and sizes,
but are characterised by the fact that
the hollows between the waves are broader
than the waves themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>If undulations are made of this kind,
then there are always plenty of comparatively
flat places where the green-keeper
can put the flag, and there should
never be any necessity to cut the hole
on a slope.</p>

<p>A test of a good undulation is that it
should be easy to use the mowing machine
over it.</p>

<p>If undulations are made of the kind I
describe, it is hardly possible to make
them too large or too bold.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most aggravating type
of undulation is the finicky little hump
or side-slope which you don’t see until
after you have missed your putt, and
then begin to wonder why it has not gone
in the hole.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The home green at Sitwell Park</span>: An undulating
green with a wide choice of places for the hole in the hollows or on the

</div>

<p>An almost equally common delusion
is that fairways should be flat. I quite
agree that there is nothing worse than
a fairway on a severe side-slope, but,
on the other hand, there are few things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
more monotonous than playing every
shot from a dead flat fairway. The
unobservant player never seems to realise
that one of the chief charms of the best
seaside links is the undulating fairways,
such as those near the club-house at
Deal, part of Sandwich, and most of the
old course at St. Andrews, where the
ground is a continual roll from the first
tee to the last green, and where one never
has the same shot to play twice; on these
fairways one hardly ever has a level
stance or a level lie. It is this that makes
the variety of a seaside course, and variety
is everything in golf.</p>

<p>If one considers St. Andrews hole by
hole, it is surprising to find at how many
of them the dominating and important
incident is associated with an insignificant-looking
hollow or bank, often running
obliquely to the line of your approach.</p>

<p>In constructing undulations of this kind
on inland courses, it is well to make them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
with as much variety as possible, and in
the direction you wish the player to
go to keep the fairway comparatively
flat, so as to encourage players to place
their shots, and thus get in a favourable
position for their next.</p>

<p>In this connection plasticine is frequently
used for making models of undulations.
Plasticine is useful to teach
the green-keeper points in construction
he would not otherwise understand—in
fact, I believe, I was the first designer
of golf courses to use it for this purpose.
The 14th green at Alwoodley, which was
the first one made there, was constructed
from a model in plasticine. It has its
disadvantages, however, as a course constructed
entirely from models in plasticine
has always an artificial appearance,
and can never be done as cheaply as
one in which the green-keeper is allowed
a comparatively free hand in modelling
the undulations in such a manner that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
not only do they harmonise with their
surroundings, but are constructed according
to the various changes in the subsoil
discovered whilst doing the work.</p>

<h3>THE FOLLY OF FASHIONS</h3>

<p>In regard to the fifth principle that
every hole should have a different character.
A common mistake is to follow
prevailing fashions. At first we had
the artificial cop bunkers extending in
a dead straight line from the rough on
one side to the rough on the other; in
modern course architecture these are fortunately
extinct. Secondly, we had the
fashion of pot bunkers running down each
side of the course. This was, if anything,
an even more objectionable type of golf
than the last. Thirdly, we have had
what has been called the alpinisation
of golf courses.</p>

<p>In this connection I would point out
that green-keepers should be careful not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to make hillocks so high in the direct
line to the hole that they block out
the view: a little to one side of the bee
line they may be made as high as one
pleases, but in the direct line hollows
should, as a rule, take the place of hillocks.
This is the exact opposite to what is
found on many golf courses, where the
hollows are at the sides and the banks
in the middle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Artificial hummock at Moortown, constructed from the
stones removed from the fairway.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The great thing in constructing golf
courses is to ensure variety and make everything
look natural. The greatest compliment
that can be paid to a green-keeper
is for players to think his artificial work
is natural. On Alwoodley and Moortown
practically every green and every hummock
has been artificially made, and yet
it is difficult to convince the stranger
that this is so. I remember a chairman
of the Green Committee of one of the
best-known clubs in the North telling
me that it would be impossible to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
their course anything like Alwoodley, as
there we had such a wealth of natural
hillocks, hollows, and undulations. It was
only with great difficulty that I was able
to persuade him that, to use an Irishism,
these natural features which he so much
admired had all been artificially created.
I have even heard one of the members of
our own Green Committee telling a well-known
writer on golf that the hummocks
surrounding one of our greens had always
been there: he himself had forgotten
that he had been present when the site
for them had been pegged out.</p>

<h3>THE QUESTION OF BLIND HOLES</h3>

<p>It is not nearly as common an error
to make blind holes as formerly. A blind
tee shot may be forgiven, or a full shot
to the green on a seaside course, when the
greens can usually be located accurately
by the position of the surrounding hummocks,
but an approach shot should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
never be blind, as this prevents an
expert player, except by a fluke, from
placing his approach so near the hole that
he gets down in one putt.</p>

<p>Blind holes on an inland course where
there are no surrounding sandhills to
locate the green should never be permitted,
but an even more annoying form
of blindness is that which is so frequent
on inland courses—that is, when the
flag is visible but the surface of the
green cannot be seen. On a green
of this description no one can possibly
tell whether the flag is at the back,
middle, or front of the green, and it is
particularly aggravating to play your shot
expecting to find it dead, and to discover
that your ball is at least twenty yards
short.</p>

<p>On a seaside course there may be a
certain amount of pleasurable excitement
in running up to the top of a hillock
in the hope of seeing your ball near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
flag, but this is a kind of thing one gets
rather tired of as one grows older.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF BEAUTY</h3>

<p>Another common erroneous idea is that
beauty does not matter on a golf course.
One often hears players say that they
don’t care a “tinker’s cuss” about their
surroundings: what they want is good golf.</p>

<p>One of the best-known writers on golf has
recently been jeering at golf architects
for attempting to make beautiful bunkers.
If he prefers ugly bunkers, ugly greens,
and ugly surroundings generally he is
welcome to them, but I don’t think for
an instant that he believes what he is
writing about, for at the same time he talks
about the beauties of natural courses. The
chief object of every golf architect or green-keeper
worth his salt is to imitate the
beauties of nature so closely as to make
his work indistinguishable from nature
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>I haven’t the smallest hesitation in
saying that beauty means a great deal
on a golf course; even the man who
emphatically states he does not care a
hang for beauty is subconsciously influenced
by his surroundings. A beautiful hole
not only appeals to the short handicap
player but also to the long, and there
are few first-rate holes which are not at
the same time, either in the grandeur of
their undulations and hazards, or the
character of their surroundings, beautiful
holes.</p>

<p>It is not suggested that we should all
play round the links after the manner of
the curate playing with the deaf old
Scotsman.</p>

<p>The curate was audibly expressing his
admiration of the scenery, the greens,
and things in general, until they finally
arrived at a green surrounded by a rookery.
The curate remarked, “Isn’t it delightful
to hear the rooks?” The deaf old Scotsman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
said, “What’s that?” The curate
again remarked, “Isn’t it delightful to
hear the rooks?” The old Scotsman
replied, “I can’t hear a word you’re
saying for those damned crows.”</p>

<p>The finest courses in existence are
natural ones. Such courses as St. Andrews,
and the championship courses
generally, are admitted to provide a
fine test of golf. It is by virtue of
their natural formation that they do so.
The beauty of gold courses has suffered
in the past from the creations of ugly
and unimaginative design. Square, flat
greens and geometrical bunkers have not
only been an eyesore upon the whole
landscape, but have detracted from the
infinite variety of play which is the heritage
of the game.</p>

<p>My reputation in the past has been
based on the fact that I have endeavoured
to conserve existing natural features, and
where these are lacking to create formations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in the spirit of nature herself.</p>

<p>In other words, while always keeping
uppermost the provision of a splendid
test of golf, I have striven to achieve
beauty.</p>

<p>It may at first appear unreasonable
that the question of æsthetics should
enter into golf-course design; however,
on deeper analysis, it becomes clear that
the great courses, and in detail all the
famous holes and greens, are fascinating
to the golfer by reason of their shape,
their situation, and the character of their
modelling. When these elements obey
the fundamental laws of balance, of harmony,
and fine proportion they give rise
to what we call beauty. This excellence
of design is more felt than fully realised
by the player, but nevertheless it is
constantly exercising a subconscious influence
upon him, and in course of time
he grows to admire such a course as all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
works of beauty are eventually felt and
admired.</p>

<h3>THE REAL OBJECT OF THE HAZARD</h3>

<p>Most of the remaining principles depend
on the proper disposition of hazards,
and I have a rather wider definition of
hazards than is given by the rules of
Golf Committee. As a minor kind of
hazard undulating ground, hummocks,
hollows, etc., might be included.</p>

<p>Most golfers have an entirely erroneous
view of the real object of hazards. The
majority of them simply look upon hazards
as a means of punishing a bad shot, when
their real object is to make the game interesting.
The attitude of the ordinary golfer
towards hazards may be illustrated by
the following tale which I have frequently
told before, but which will bear repeating:</p>

<p>A player visiting a Scotch course asked
his caddie what the members thought
of a stream which was winding in and out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
between several of the holes. The caddie
replied, “Weel, we’ve got an old Scotch
major here. When he gets it ower he
says, ‘Weel ower the bonnie wee burn,
ma laddie’; but when he gets in he
says, ‘Pick ma ball oot o’ that domned
sewer.’”</p>

<p>The writer was recently playing with
his brother, who was home on leave
from abroad. He was clearly enjoying
his game, but at Alwoodley we have
one solitary pond into which he topped
three balls. On arriving at the club-house
he was asked how he liked the course;
he simply remarked, “There were too many
ruddy ponds about.”</p>

<p>It is much too large a subject to go
into the question of the placing of
hazards, but I would like to emphasise a
fundamental principle. It is that, as already
pointed out, no hazard is unfair
wherever it is placed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The fifteenth hole on the City of Newcastle
course</span>: constructed on flat, featureless clay land.</p>
</div>

<p>A hazard placed in the exact position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
where a player would naturally go is
frequently the most interesting situation,
as then a special effort is needed to get
over or avoid it.</p>

<h3>GIVING THE PLAYER THRILLS</h3>

<p>One of the objects in placing hazards
is to give the players as much pleasurable
excitement as possible. On many inland
courses there is not a thrill on the
whole round, and yet on some of the championship
courses one rarely takes a club
out of the bag without having an interesting
shot to play. This particularly applies
to the old course at St. Andrews, and is
one of the reasons why it always retains
its popularity with all classes of players.
It is quite true that even this course is
condemned by some, but this may be
due to the fact that they have not brains
enough, or have not played on it long
enough, to appreciate its many virtues.</p>

<p>There are some leading players who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
honestly dislike the dramatic element in
golf. They hate anything that is likely
to interfere with a constant succession
of threes and fours. They look upon
everything in the “card and pencil”
spirit. The average club member on the
other hand is a keen sportsman, he looks
upon golf in the “spirit of adventure,”
and that is why St. Andrews and courses
modelled on similar ideals appeal to him.</p>

<p>No one would pretend that the old
course at St. Andrews is perfect: it
has its disadvantages, particularly in the
absence of long carries from the tee, and
in its blind bunkers, but no links in
the world grows upon all classes of players
in the same manner. The longer one
plays there the keener one gets, and this
is a much truer test of a good course than
one which pleases at first and is boring
later on.</p>

<p>A good golf course is like good music
or good anything else; it is not necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
a course which appeals the first time one
plays over it, but one which grows on the
player the more frequently he visits it.</p>

<p>St. Andrews is a standing example of
the possibility of making a course which
is pleasurable to all classes of golfers,
not only to the thirty handicap players,
but to the plus fourteen man, if there ever
was or will be such a person.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that few hazards
are of any interest which are out of what
is known among medical men as the direct
field of vision. This does not extend
much farther than ten to twenty yards
on either side of the direct line to the
hole. Hazards placed outside this limit
are usually of little interest, but simply
act as a source of irritation.</p>

<p>Hazards should be placed with an object,
and none should be made which has not
some influence on the line of play to the
hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<h3>TOO MANY BUNKERS</h3>

<p>On many courses there are far too many
bunkers: the sides of the fairways are
riddled with them, and many of these
courses would be equally interesting if
half of the bunkers were turfed over as
grassy hollows.</p>

<p>It is often possible to make a hole
sufficiently interesting with one or two
bunkers at the most. For example:</p>

<p>It is obvious from the diagram that
the green-guarding bunker B has a considerable
influence on the line of play
to the hole.</p>

<p>The longer the carry a player achieves
over the stream the easier his second
shot becomes.</p>

<p>If it were not for this bunker not only
the approach but the tee shot would be
uninteresting, as there would be no object
in essaying the long carry over the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram of hole of 370 yards, illustrating the value
of one bunker, B.</span> Any additional bunker for the tee shot or across
the approach to the green would materially lessen the interest of the
hole. The moral is “Few bunkers placed in interesting positions!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>Many poor golf courses are made in
a futile attempt to eliminate the element
of luck. You can no more eliminate luck
in golf than in cricket, and in neither
case is it possible to punish every bad
shot. If you succeeded you would only
make both games uninteresting.</p>

<p>There are many points of resemblance
between cricket and golf: the fielders
in cricket correspond to the hazards at
golf. The fielders are placed in the
positions where the majority of shots
go, and it should obviously be easier
with a stationary ball to avoid the
hazards than to avoid the fielders at
cricket.</p>

<p>In both games it is only a proportion
of bad shots that get punished, but
notwithstanding this the man who is playing
the best game almost invariably comes
out on top.</p>

<p>It is an important thing in golf to make
holes look much more difficult than they
really are. People get more pleasure in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
doing a hole which looks almost impossible,
and yet is not so difficult as it
appears.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be pointed
out that rough grass is of little interest
as a hazard. It is frequently much more
difficult than a fearsome-looking bunker
or belt of whins or rushes, but it causes
considerable annoyance in lost balls, and
no one ever gets the same thrills in driving
over a stretch of rough as over a
fearsome-looking bunker, which in reality
may not be so severe.</p>

<p>Narrow fairways bordered by long grass
make bad golfers. They do so by destroying
the harmony and continuity of the
game, and in causing a stilted and cramped
style by destroying all freedom of play.</p>

<p>There is no defined line between the
fairways in the great schools of golf like
St. Andrews or Hoylake.</p>

<p>It is a common error to cut the
rough in straight lines. It should be cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
in irregular, natural-looking curves. The
fairways should gradually widen out where
a long drive goes; in this way a long
driver is given a little more latitude in
pulling and slicing.</p>

<p>Moreover irregular curves assist a
player in locating the exact position of
a ball which has left the fairway and
entered the rough.</p>

<h3>GLORIFIED MOLE-HILLS</h3>

<p>Hummocks and hollows should be made
of all sorts of different shapes and sizes,
and should have a natural appearance,
with plenty of slope at the bottom like
large waves. Most of the hummocks and
hollows should be made so smooth that
the mowing machine can be used over
them. The glorified mole-hills one sees
on many courses should be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus7">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The artificial hummocks guarding the fifth green at

The best way of combining sand and hummocks, with the sand on the slope
of the hazard above the ground level.</p>
</div>

<p>Bunkers on an inland course should,
as a rule, be made in the opposite way to
what is customary. At the present time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
most bunkers have the hollows sanded and
the banks turfed. It is suggested that
you get a much more natural appearance
if the hollows are partly turfed over and
the hummocks sanded, as in the photographs
in these pages. This has the following
advantages: the appearance is
much more like a seaside course; the
sand being above the level of the ground,
always remains dry. The contrast between
white or yellow sand and the grass
helps one to judge distances much more
accurately, and enables the ball to be
found more easily, and the great disadvantage
and expense of scything the long
grass on the hummocks to prevent lost
balls is done away with.</p>

<p>Ordinary bunkers are, as a rule, made
in quite the wrong way. The face is
usually too upright and the ball gets into
an unplayable position under the face.
The bottom of the bank of a bunker
should have a considerable slope, so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
a ball always rolls to the middle; the
top of a bunker may, as it usually does
in nature, be made to overhang a little
so as to prevent a topped ball running
through it.</p>

<p>Experience gained in the imitation of
natural slopes in bunker-making was ultimately
responsible for saving tens of
thousands of pounds in revetting material
in the great war.</p>

<p>Trenches with the sides made like a
bank of a stream with a considerable
slope at the bottom remained standing
without any revetting material.</p>

<p>Before this principle was pointed out
soldiers invariably dug their trenches with
a slope at the top, and as they got farther
down the sides became more vertical and
sometimes were even undercut. A trench
of this kind invariably fell in, whereas
those made vertical at the top with the
slope at the bottom did not do so.</p>

<p>Hazards are usually placed too far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
away from the greens they are intended
to guard; they should be placed immediately
on the edge of the greens, and
then (particularly if they are in the form
of smooth hillocks and hollows) the player
who is wide of them has an extremely
difficult pitch, and is frequently worse
off than the man who is in them.</p>

<p>A bunker eating into a green is by far
the most equitable way of giving a golfer
full advantage for accurate play. It not
only penalises the man who is in it, but
every one who is wide of it. For example,
a player who is in the road bunker at
the seventeenth at St. Andrews may
with a good dunch shot get out and lie
dead, but few can pitch over it so accurately
that they do so. A bunker, similarly
placed to the road bunker, may be made
to accentuate this distinction; it may
be constructed with so much slope that
on occasions it can be putted out of.</p>

<p>Hummocks on the edge of greens are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
often constructed so that they assist the
man who has opened up the hole correctly;
they act as a hazard only to those who
have failed to do this.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious mistake made
by a golf committee is the fallacy that
they will save money by neglecting to
obtain expert advice in regard to fresh
construction work.</p>

<p>Except where the course has been designed
and the construction work supervised
by the modern golf architect, there
is hardly a golf club of any size which has
not frittered away hundreds of pounds in
doing bad work, all for the want of the
best advice in the first instance.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the
poorer the club the more important it
is for it not to waste its small funds
in doing the wrong kind of work, but
to get the best possible advice from its
inception.</p>

<h3>THE COURSE FOR THE BEGINNER</h3>

<p>I notice a well-known club, in forming
a golf course, state that the committee
have decided to lay it out themselves,
as they are afraid of a golf architect
making it too difficult for the average
player. Now this is precisely what the
modern golf architect does not do; he
in particular adopts a most sympathetic
attitude to the beginner and long handicap
player, but at the same time attempts
to make the course interesting to all
sorts and conditions of players. It is
characteristic of the modern architect
that he always leaves a broad and pleasurable
road that leads to destruction—that
is, sixes and sevens on the card of the
long handicap player—but a straight and
narrow path which leads to salvation—that
is, threes and fours for the plus
man.</p>

<p>The writer has just returned from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
most delightful sand-dune country which
he chose for his holiday in great part
owing to the fact that he had seen it before
and had also seen Mr. Colt’s plan for the
constructing of what should have been
the finest eighteen-hole course in England.</p>

<p>On arrival he found the secretary or
the committee had, through motives of
false economy, refrained from getting Mr.
Colt to supervise the work and had done
it themselves. The outcome was an expenditure
of three or four times as much
money as Mr. Colt would have needed,
the destruction of many of the beautiful
natural undulations and features which
were the making of Mr. Colt’s scheme,
the conversion of magnificent visible
greens into semi-blind ones, banked up
like croquet lawns, and a complete absence
of turf owing to wrong treatment, and
alterations in the placing of the tees,
bunkers, and greens, and a total disregard
of the beginner and the long handicap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
player. On a seaside course in particular
little construction work is necessary; the
important thing is to make the fullest
possible use of existing features. £500
in labour expended under expert supervision
is better than £10,000 injudiciously
expended.</p>

<p>Surely in the case of a golf club it
is more important to have an architect
for the course, and any new work on the
course, than for the club-house. Much
greater mistakes are made in constructing
the former than in building the latter.</p>

<p>One can readily imagine what would
be the ultimate result of a course laid out
by an average committee composed of
scratch, three, four, and eight handicap
men. They are, most of them (probably
subconsciously), prejudiced against any
hazard being constructed which they are
likely to get into themselves, but they
are all unanimous in thinking that the
poor devil with a twenty-four handicap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
should be left out of consideration altogether.
The final result is neither fish,
flesh, fowl, nor even good red herring.</p>

<h3>THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE EXPERT</h3>

<p>The expert in golf architecture has to
be intimately conversant with the theory
of playing the game, but this has no
connection with the physical skill in
playing it. An ideal golf expert should
not only have a knowledge of botany,
geology, and particularly agricultural
chemistry, but should also have what
might be termed an artistic temperament
and vivid imagination. We all know that
there is nothing so fatal in playing golf
as to have a vivid imagination, but this
and a sufficient knowledge of psychology
to enable one to determine what is likely
to give the greatest pleasure to the greatest
number are eminently desirable in a
golf architect. The training of the expert
should be mental, not physical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>My last principle is one which particularly
affects the green-keeper:—the
course should be perfect all the year
round.</p>

<p>It is quite a prevalent idea that courses
on a clay subsoil can never be made into
good winter links. It does not matter
so much as might be expected, what
the subsoil is like, provided it is well
drained and the turf on the top is of the
right texture. Muddy courses are entirely
due to insufficient drainage, worms,
and the wrong kind of turf.</p>

<p>Worms can be got rid of and the right
kind of turf encouraged by adopting
modern methods of green-keeping. Many
examples of what can be done in converting
really bad winter courses into good
ones can be seen in the North. Surface
drainage, such as mole draining, gets rid
of worms by making the land so dry that
they cannot work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<h3>SOME HINTS ON GREEN TREATMENT</h3>

<p>A common mistake in green-keeping is
to imagine that because one form of
treatment benefits one course that it
will necessarily benefit another.</p>

<p>The green-keeper should have sufficient
knowledge of chemistry and botany to
be able to tell exactly what form of
treatment is most likely to benefit his
greens.</p>

<p>For example, the ordinary artificial
manure sold by some seeds merchants
for golf courses consists of a mixture of
three parts of superphosphate of lime,
one part each sulphate of ammonia
and sulphate of potash, and one-tenth
part of sulphate of iron. If no weeds
are present, the sulphate of iron may be
omitted from the mixture; if daisies are
present, the sulphate of ammonia should
be increased; if clover is present, the
potash and lime should be lessened in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
quantity; if the turf is sour, or if sorrel
is present, the sulphate of ammonia should
be lessened, and lime used as a separate
dressing.</p>

<p>Farmyard manure should not, as a rule,
be used as a surface dressing on golf
courses: it is much too likely to encourage
weeds and worms.</p>

<p>Something of the nature of Peruvian
guano, fish guano, meat guano, malt
culms, or dried blood, together with artificials,
should be used in its place. If
humus is necessary, it may be added in
the form of peat moss litter, minced
seaweed, etc., and the box should seldom
be used on the mowing machines.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the turf
required on a golf course is entirely
different to that required from a farming
point of view.</p>

<p>It is now an absolutely exploded fallacy
that worms are of any use on a golf
course; they should be got rid of by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
use of charcoal obtained from steel furnaces:
ordinary wood charcoal is almost
useless. Charcoal in this form acts mechanically,
owing to the small sharp pieces
of steel attached to it: it scratches the
worms and prevents them getting through.</p>

<p>Worm-killers, especially those consisting
of Mowrah Meal, are of great value in destroying
worms.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to consider that worm-killers,
unless mixed with an artificial
manure, have any manurial value. The
green-keeper will tell you that after the
application the grass has come up much
greener. That is due to the fact that
the worms are no longer discolouring
it by crawling over it with their slimy
bodies.</p>

<h3>THE MOWING OF GREENS</h3>

<p>A common mistake is not to mow
greens during the winter months. I have
not the slightest doubt that mowing greens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
during the winter months is beneficial
to them: it keeps the grass from becoming
coarse.</p>

<p>On those Scotch courses where the greens
are so good all through the winter, are
not the rabbits mowing the greens all
through the winter months?</p>

<p>Are the knives of the mowing machine
any more likely to do the grass harm than
the teeth of the rabbits?</p>

<p>It is a common mistake in sowing a
green not to use a sufficient quantity of
seed. The ground should always be
thoroughly prepared and manured according
to the chemical composition of
the soil; then as much as five or six
bushels of seed per green can be sown to
advantage.</p>

<p>Mixtures of grass seeds may be sold
consisting of a considerable proportion
of seeds which do not germinate, and are
not likely to do so, on ordinary soils.
Unscrupulous seeds merchants may undercut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the more honest ones in this way. Three
bushels of the best seeds will go further
than six containing a large proportion
of varieties which are not likely to germinate.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter on General
Principles, it may be pointed out that,
although many of these ideas may appear
revolutionary, the reader may be assured
that their success under varying conditions
has been proved in practice.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOME FURTHER SUGGESTIONS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It cannot be too frequently emphasised
that in starting a new course or reconstructing
an old one it is of the utmost
importance that the committee should
have a scheme before them of a definite
and final nature. It would be sound finance
for the majority of golf clubs to pay the
expenses of the Green Committee for
the purpose of visiting good examples
of construction work on other courses.</p>

<p>They should not of necessity visit courses
where the leading open competitions are
held, as many of the very best clubs
rarely offer their courses for competitions.</p>

<p>They should be guided in their choice
of architect by a course constructed out
of indifferent material, and not by one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
constructed out of magnificent natural
golfing land.</p>

<p>They should take into consideration
the cost, the popularity with all classes
of players, and the finality and permanency
of the work.</p>

<p>Having decided on the architect and
having passed the plan, it is as well to
take steps to ensure that the construction
work is done according to the ideas of
the designer.</p>

<p>Experience of advising a hundred golf
clubs has convinced the writer that the
work can never be done properly except
under occasional expert supervision. Work
done without expert supervision is invariably
bad.</p>

<p>The designer should not be tied down
too closely to his original plan. Mature
consideration and unexpected changes in
the subsoil, etc., may make a modification
in the plan necessary to save expense and
get better results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>In a small book of this kind, it is impossible
to go into the thousand and one
details which make for economy in course
construction, but some of these may be
enumerated.</p>

<p>The chief items in the construction of
a golf course are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Carting.</li>
<li>2. Labour.</li>
<li>3. Drainage.</li>
<li>4. Seeding.</li>
<li>5. Turfing.</li>
<li>6. Manures.</li>
<li>7. Sand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CARTING</h3>

<p>The cost of carting can often be reduced
to a minimum by using a little thought
in the work. The stone from stone walls,
rocks, the turf from turf walls, or soil
taken out of excavations should never
be carted away: they can always be
used for raising a neighbouring green in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the form of a plateau, or in making
hummocks or large undulations indistinguishable
from the natural ones which
are so delightful on seaside courses. It
is rarely necessary to cart soil from a
distance for the purpose of making a
hummock or a green. It is much more
economical to remove a sufficient area of
turf from and around the site of an intended
hummock or green, and utilise
the soil removed from the area around
the hummock for this purpose. This is
a double advantage. The surrounding
ground is lowered as the hummock is
raised, and makes the hummock appear
higher, and at the same time it is made
to merge imperceptibly into the surrounding
hollow or hollows, and has a much
more natural appearance. A hollow removed
from the front of the green has
the effect of making the green appear as
if it were raised upon a plateau, and this
is still further accentuated if the soil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
removed is also used to build up the
green.</p>

<p>Similarly the green and the bunkers
guarding it should all be made at the
same time; the soil moved in making the
bunkers can then be utilised in the formation
of the green. It was in former
years considered imprudent to construct
bunkers until the experience of playing
revealed the proper position, but since
those days our knowledge of green-keeping
has advanced. An expert can judge by
the character of the grasses and the
nature of the undulations the amount of
run which the ball is likely to get, and
this knowledge, combined with actual
measurements, gives more information
than it is possible to gain by playing.
Perhaps the most important reason why
the architect’s scheme should be completed
in the first instance is that bunkers
are hardly ever placed in the right position
afterwards. It is difficult to find a member<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of a Green Committee who is not
subconsciously prejudiced against placing
a bunker where he is likely to get
trapped himself.</p>

<p>After carting there is usually a considerable
amount of labour necessary to
obliterate the tracks. Carting should,
when possible, be done when the ground
is hard, in dry weather or during frost.
Carts should not be allowed to wander
about all over the place, but should be
made to keep in one track. It is often
advisable to remove the turf previous to
carting and relay it after the carting is
finished. Carts can sometimes be replaced
with advantage by sledges with flat-bottomed
runners.</p>

<h3>LABOUR AT LESS THAN PRE-WAR COST</h3>

<p>By introducing labour-saving machinery
we have recently been getting better results
at less than pre-war cost. If work on
a large scale is being done, the steam navvy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
or grab might be tried for excavating
and making hummocks, etc.; traction
engines are useful in uprooting small trees,
and larger ones can with advantage be
blown up by dynamite. I recently used
blasting charges for the purpose of assisting
to make bunkers. An article in one of
the Sheffield papers somewhat humorously
stated that this was not the first occasion
Dr. Mackenzie’s bunkers had been
“blasted.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The “Scraper” at work on Wheatley Park course,
Doncaster.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Trolleys on rails are frequently used to
save carting or wheeling barrows.</p>

<p>The two machines which are found of
the greatest value in saving labour are
the turf-cutting machine and the American
scraper or scoop—the former made
from designs by the writer. It will cut
an acre of sods in an afternoon, and,
moreover, cuts them of a more even thickness
than by hand. This machine is
worked by two horses like a plough. One
or two clubs have condemned it without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
a fair trial, and on inquiry I have usually
found that the weather was too dry,
the grass too long, the blades had not been
set properly, or that it had been used by
a man who had had no previous experience
in working one. It has been used by
scores of clubs with a great deal of success.
At Moortown we sodded over twenty
acres of sour heath land with it. The
cost of this amounted to little compared
with sowing, as we were able to remove
the sods from a neighbouring field. Sowing
would have cost at least twice as
much, as there were no signs of even a
blade of grass on most of the land, and
no sowing was likely to be successful
without lime and manuring, and carting
a tremendous quantity of soil so as to
form a seed bed. The results have been
infinitely better and quicker than sowing
at the rate of even twelve bushels of the
best grass seeds to the acre.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Grange-over-Sands</span>: sandhills constructed by means
of the scraper on terrain originally perfectly flat.</p>
</div>

<p>The scraper is worked by a horse or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
horses, and is particularly useful for excavating
light soil, but can even be used on
heavy land if each layer is ploughed before
the scraper is used. The scraper is shaped
like a large shovel, the handles are raised,
and the horse pulls and it digs into the
ground until it is full; the handles are
then depressed and the horse pulls it
along to the required situation; it is
then tipped up, and the horse returns for
another load. One horse and two men
by this means can do the work of a
score of men working in the ordinary way
with wheelbarrows. In making hollows
and hummocks it has an additional advantage
in that it gives them automatically
a natural appearance, and at the
same time the horse in climbing up to
the top of the hump compresses the
soil, and it does not sink so much afterwards.</p>

<p>The scraper has been used with considerable
success at Castletown (Isle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Man), Wheatley Park (Doncaster), and
Grange-over-Sands, among other courses.</p>

<p>It is important in constructing a new
or altering an old course to get the work
done as quickly as possible: if the work
is done gradually the sods lie about for
some time and are sometimes ruined.
Most of the work should be done during
October and November, before the frosts
commence: good methods of organisation
should prevent men being unemployed
during frost. If the greens, drains, and
sites of bunkers are previously pared, and
the sods allowed to lie, then even though
frost sets in, the sods may be removed and
a certain amount of excavation can still
be proceeded with. Sand, soil, and manures
may be carted, hedges stubbed up,
and trees removed during frost.</p>

<h3>DRAINAGE</h3>

<p>It is advisable to drain golfing land
much more thoroughly and efficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
than ordinary farm land, but, on the other
hand, by exercising a little thought it
can be done much more cheaply. For
the purpose of golf it is not only unnecessary
to drain as deeply as is customary
for agricultural purposes, but it
is much cheaper and more satisfactory to
adopt a system of shallow drains.</p>

<p>On a golf course, there is never any
necessity to make allowance for the possibility
of subsoil ploughing; the drains
can therefore be kept near the surface.
The great thing to bear in mind in draining
is that the water stratum must be
tapped. On heavy clay land, it is absurd
to put drains in the middle of the clay,
unless the whole of the trench is filled
with clinkers or other porous material, and
this is needlessly expensive. Drains may at
times be placed in a groove on the surface
of the clay. On land of this description
drains may often be placed with
advantage at as shallow a depth as from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
6 to 12 inches. It should be unnecessary
to state that no effort should be spared
to see that there is sufficient fall, and for
the purpose of ensuring this it is often
necessary to take the levels. Sufficient
thought is rarely given to drainage. The
site of the main drains and the whole
scheme of drainage should be very carefully
studied, and it is of special importance
to take into consideration the nature of
the subsoil and position of the water
level. In peat, on the other hand, it
is frequently advisable to drain below
the peat, even if this extends to a depth
of 6 feet or more. If this is impossible
owing to lack of sufficient fall, wooden
boards should be placed below the drains.</p>

<p>The cheapest method of draining is
by a system of mole drainage. I have
frequently used a mole drain worked by
horses which was made from suggestions
by Franks, the Moortown green-keeper,
and myself. It is used as an attachment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to the turf-cutting machine. By this
method golf courses on clay land could
be drained, previous to the war, at less
than a pound per acre.</p>

<p>This mole drain works at the shallow
depth of 6 inches, and is not applicable
to agricultural land, as even horses galloping
over the ground are sufficient to block
the channel. It is, moreover, wonderfully
satisfactory on golfing land, especially
as supplementary to ordinary tile draining.
Whenever the ground is sticky, or
any casual water appears, the mole is
run through and it becomes absolutely
dry at once. This mole drain has a big
advantage over the larger one, in that
the cut made by the mole is so small
that it does not interfere with the lie
of the ball.</p>

<p>We have recently used a tractor instead
of horses to pull the mole, and have
found it a great advantage to do so.
The use of the mole provides a solution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
for the problem of converting the muddiest
of clay London courses into good winter
links. Experience has proved that the
effect lasts for fully ten years.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable results
of its use is that it gets rid of worms.
This is probably owing to the fact that
it makes the ground so dry that the
worms can’t work in it.</p>

<p>It also prevents the ground becoming
baked during dry summer weather. This
is a well-known effect of good drainage,
although possibly an unexpected one to
the uninitiated. It is largely due to
the drainage preventing the ground becoming
caked, and also to the encouragement
of turf with a good bottom to it.</p>

<h3>TURFING</h3>

<p>The cheapest and best method of removing
turf is by means of a turf-cutting
machine. The thickness of the turf should
vary according to the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
grasses and the character of the subsoil.
As a general rule, turf for greens should
be cut as thin as 1½ inches. This is
particularly important if the turf contains
many tap-rooted weeds; the roots of
the weeds and many of the coarser grasses
are then left behind in the cutting.</p>

<p>In the experience of the writer, it is
frequently not a difficult matter to get
excellent turf in the immediate neighbourhood
of a golf course at an extremely
cheap rate—a halfpenny a yard or under—and
turf obtained from the immediate
neighbourhood of the course is much
more likely to be suitable than turf
obtained elsewhere. The writer has known
a golf club going to the expense of getting
Silloth turf at 9<i>d.</i> a yard, the grasses of
which would inevitably disappear and be
replaced by those of its environment
within a year or two, when much more
suitable turf could be obtained from the
next field at a cost of a farthing a yard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
It should be borne in mind that the most
useless turf from a farming point of
view is frequently the most valuable
for golf. There are many other details
which help to lessen the cost of turfing.
In an old-established course, turf for new
greens or for renovating old ones can
frequently be obtained from the sides of
a neighbouring fairway, the sods from
which may be replaced by those removed
from the site of the green.</p>

<p>There is usually a well-trodden path
extending from every tee to the nearest
fairway. There is no turf so useful for
renovating an old or making a new tee as
that obtained from a firm path of this kind.
The sods removed should be replaced by
others, and they in turn get hard and firm.</p>

<p>An important question is the use of
manures in turfing. Stable or farmyard
manure should almost invariably be placed
under the sods: the amount should vary
according to the turf and soil. Five loads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
per green is an average, and on undulating
greens the manure should be placed under
the raised portions only. The hollows
will look after themselves. Manure does
more harm than good if dug deeply in:
it should be forked in immediately under
the sods, and the roots of the finer grasses
feed on it at once. If dug in deeply, the
coarser grasses are encouraged at the
expense of the finer.</p>

<p>On wormy inland courses considerable
expense in worm-killers can frequently
be saved by placing a few loads of coke
breeze under the sods.</p>

<p>Although the best time to turf is in
the late autumn and winter months, sods
can, if necessity arises, be laid in certain
localities as late as June.</p>

<p>If hot dry weather arrives, the newly
laid sods should be covered with cut
grass during the day, and in the evening
the grass should be removed so that the
dews help to keep the ground moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<h3>SEEDING</h3>

<p>The writer has known of several instances
where ground has been sown, and
the result has been so unsatisfactory that
after a year or two the land had to be
ploughed up and resown.</p>

<p>It is much more economical in the long
run to do the thing thoroughly. Mistakes
are most frequently made in sowing with
the wrong seeds—in not preparing the
ground thoroughly beforehand, and in
sowing at the wrong time of year.</p>

<p>It is most important that a mixture
should be chosen containing a goodly
proportion of seeds corresponding to the
prevailing grasses of the immediate neighbourhood,
and seeds should always be
obtained from a seeds merchant who is not
afraid of telling you the exact composition
of his mixture. Some seeds merchants sell
mixtures which are not so valuable for
golfing turf as they appear—it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the best kind of grass which germinates
too quickly. Finer turf usually results from
a mixture which comes up more slowly
but is of a more permanent character.
If seeding is necessary, it is frequently
advisable to sow with much larger quantity
of seed than is customary.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance to
prepare the land thoroughly before sowing.
The ground should be well drained, the
land well limed when necessary, and
fifteen loads to the acre of well-rotted
stable manure incorporated with the soil
or a mixture of artificial manure in its
stead.</p>

<p>After sowing see that the birds are
scared away by one of the numerous
devices suggested for the purpose.</p>

<h3>MANURES</h3>

<p>It is surprising how much money can
be saved in manures by the help of science
and a sufficient knowledge of chemistry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to enable you to judge which are the
cheapest and most valuable manures suitable
for the soil of the locality with which
you have to deal.</p>

<p>It is often advisable to make a point
of studying the by-products of the different
industries in the district, as it is obvious
that if a suitable manure for the soil can
be obtained on the spot, it is obtained
cheaper than by rail or cart from a distance.
Fish or meat guano, basic slag,
malt dust, sulphate of ammonia, chalk,
the refuse from leather, cloth, and shoddy
factories, seed crushing mills, seaweed,
manure extracted from town sewage works,
peat moss litter, etc., are all of value
under different circumstances.</p>

<p>Basic slag can sometimes be obtained
from a neighbouring steel works, sulphate
of ammonia from a gas works,
chalk from a neighbouring chalk pit, or
seaweed from the seashore. Manures
should be used with a considerable amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of discretion and only in small quantities
at a time. I have known a considerable
amount of damage done by the unintelligent
use of artificials. For example,
artificials are of the greatest possible
value for golfing turf, but they should
always be used in small quantities but
frequently, and should be well diluted
with soil or sand, and only used during
moist weather. A mixture, consisting of
superphosphate of lime, sulphate of ammonia,
and sulphate of potash, supplies
most of the feeding material that is
necessary for golf, and the experiments
at Rothamstead conclusively prove that
the character of the grasses can be
completely altered by varying the proportion
of the different constituents of
this mixture.</p>

<p>Sulphate of ammonia is the most valuable
of the constituents of this mixture,
but I have known of several greens (including
even St. Andrews) temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
ruined by using sulphate of ammonia
injudiciously. It should never be put on
a green undiluted, as, like most artificials,
it has a great affinity for water, and in
dry weather absorbs the water from the
grasses and burns them up. It also should
never be used if the land is the least
bit sour, as it simply increases this sourness.</p>

<p>A green-keeper should attempt to get
a sufficient knowledge of botany and
chemistry to know by the character of
the herbage of his greens the kind and the
amount of manure that is required. Green-keepers
sometimes think that if they use
twice the usual quantity of a manure, it
will have double the effect; the exact
contrary is the case, as the green may be
ruined entirely.</p>

<p>The most important manure of all is
cut grass. If the cut grass is always
left on the greens and fairways, very
little manuring is necessary. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
hand, if the grass is constantly removed
year after year (unless a considerable
amount of manure is added to take its
place), the turf becomes impoverished and
full of weeds. One of the unexpected
results of leaving the grass on is that
less mowing is necessary. This is probably
due to the fact that the growth goes
into the roots and not into the leaves.
Mowing without the box on is of special
importance on sandy or seaside courses.</p>

<h3>SAND</h3>

<p>Sand is often an expensive item on
an inland course. It is surprising how
frequently a good class of sand is found
in pockets on a course or in the immediate
neighbourhood. A knowledge of geology
and botany will enable you to foretell
where sand is likely to be found.</p>

<p>On several occasions on visiting a course
I have been told that there was no sand
in the district, and have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
find some by noting the character of the
trees, grasses, etc. Sand may be economised
by the method in which bunkers
are made. It will be noticed in the
photographs reproduced that most of the
hollows have been turfed, but have
been formed in such a way that a ball
gravitates towards the sand, which is
thrown up against the face. Bunkers of
this description have a much more natural
appearance, and the amount of sand
needed is also considerably less than usual.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A bunker on the Fulford course, artificially
constructed on flat land at a cost of £3.</span></p>
</div>

<p>By far the most important of all the
foregoing suggestions is the ultimate
economy of making it as reasonably
certain as possible that any work done
is of a permanent character and has not
ultimately to be done over again. There
are few committees of golf clubs who
attach sufficient importance to expert
advice. I suppose this is partly due to
the fact that they themselves would sooner
have the work done badly and have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
fun of doing it than see any one else do
it for them. In the nature of things
a course can only be constructed by an
individual: “Too many cooks spoil the
broth” is a proverb which is more applicable
in the case of golf courses than in
anything else.</p>

<p>I personally am a strong believer in
encouraging the individuality of the green-keeper,
and not interfering with, but
rather encouraging, his original ideas, unless
they are in opposition to sound
fundamental principles.</p>

<span class="smaller">IDEAL HOLES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There are few problems more difficult
to solve than the problem of what exactly
constitutes an ideal hole. The ideal hole
is surely one that affords the greatest
pleasure to the greatest number, gives the
fullest advantage for accurate play, stimulates
players to improve their game, and
never becomes monotonous.</p>

<p>The real practical test is its popularity,
and here again we are up against another
difficulty. Does the average player really
know what he likes himself? One often
hears the same player expressing totally
divergent opinions about the same hole.
When he plays it successfully, it is everything
that is good, and when unsuccessful
it is everything that is bad. It frequently
happens that the best holes give rise to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the most bitter controversy. It is largely
a question of the spirit in which the
problem is approached. Does the player
look upon it from the “card and pencil”
point of view and condemn anything that
has disturbed his steady series of threes
and fours, or does he approach the question
in the “spirit of adventure” of the true
sportsman?</p>

<p>There are well-known players who invariably
condemn any hole they have
taken over six for, and if by any chance
they ever reach double figures, words fail
them to describe in adequate language
what they think of that particular hole.</p>

<p>It does not by any means follow that
when a player condemns a hole in particularly
vigorous language he really dislikes
it. It may be a source of pleasure
to his subconscious mind. Although
condemning it, he may be longing to
play it again so as to conquer its difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Who is to judge what is an ideal hole?
Is it one of our leading players, or any
golfer who simply looks upon it from his
own point of view? I have known of
an open champion expressing his opinion
that a certain course was superior to any
in Britain. As far as this particular
course is concerned, it is generally admitted
by amateurs that, although the
turf and natural advantages were excellent,
it had not a single hole of any real merit.
The local committee were also of opinion
that it was monotonous and lacking in
real interest, and had decided to have it
entirely remodelled, before this world renowned
open champion persuaded them
to change their minds by expressing such
strong views in its favour.</p>

<p>There are, unfortunately, many leading
players who wish a course to be designed
so that it will favour their own play and
will not even punish their indifferent
shots, but will put any one below their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
particular standard out of the running
altogether.</p>

<p>There are many leading players who
condemn the strategic aspect of golf.
They only see one line to the hole, and that
is usually the direct one. They cannot
see why they should, as in dog-legged
holes, be ever compelled to play to one
or other side of the direct line. A bunker
in the direct line at the distance of their
long drives is invariably condemned by
them, because they do not realise
that the correct line is to one or other
side of it. Why should not even an
open champion occasionally have a shot
that the long handicap man is frequently
compelled to play?</p>

<p>Should a course or hole be ideal from
a medal or match-playing point of view?
If it is necessary to draw any distinction
between the two, there can be little
doubt that match play should always
have prior claim. Nine out of ten games<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
on most good courses are played in matches
and not for medals. The true test of
a hole is, then, its value in match play.</p>

<p>The majority of golfers are agreed, I
think, that an ideal hole should be a
difficult one. It is true there are some
who would have it difficult for every one
except themselves. These, who usually
belong to the pot-hunting fraternity, may
be left out of consideration. It is the successful
negotiation of difficulties, or apparent
ones, which gives rise to pleasurable
excitement and makes a hole interesting.</p>

<p>What kind of difficulties make interesting
golf?</p>

<p>We can, I think, eliminate difficulties
consisting of long grass, narrow fairways,
and small greens, because of the annoyance
and irritation caused by searching for
lost balls, the disturbance of the harmony
and continuity of the game, the consequent
loss of freedom of swing, and the
production of bad players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>We can also eliminate blind greens, blind
bunkers, and blind approaches. The
greater the experience the writer has of
designing golf courses, the more certain
he is that blindness of all kinds should
be avoided. The only form of blindness
that should ever be permitted is the full
shot up to a green whose position is
accurately located by surrounding sandhills.
Even in a hole of this kind, it is
not the blindness that is interesting, but
the visibility of the surrounding sandhills.
At the Maiden hole at Sandwich,
it was the grandeur and the impressiveness
of the Maiden that made it a good hole,
and not the blindness of the green.</p>

<p>The difficulties that make a hole really
interesting are usually those in which a
great advantage can be gained in successfully
accomplishing heroic carries over
hazards of an impressive appearance, or
in taking great risks in placing a
shot so as to gain a big advantage for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the next. Successfully carrying or skirting
a bunker of an alarming or impressive
appearance is always a source of
satisfaction to the golfer, and yet it is
hazards of this description which so often
give rise to criticism by the unsuccessful
player. At first sight he looks upon it
as grossly unfair that, of two shots
within a few inches of each other, the one
should be hopelessly buried in a bunker
and the other should be in an ideal position.</p>

<p>However, on further consideration
he will realise that, as in dog-legged
holes, this is the chief characteristic of
all good holes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="700" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The second hole at Headingley—cost £40. Hummock and
bunkers entirely artificial</span>: a two-shot dog-legged hole; the photo
is taken along the line of the second shot.</p>
</div>

<p>Holes of this description not only cater
for great judgment, but great skill: a
man who has such confidence that he
can place his ball within a few feet of
his objective gains a big advantage over
a faint-hearted opponent who dare not
take similar risks. On a course, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
holes of this kind, match play becomes of
intense interest.</p>

<p>In a perfect hole the surface of not
only the green, but the approach to it,
should be visible. It is difficult, or even
impossible, to judge an approach accurately
unless the ground which the ball pitches
on can be seen. It also gives great
pleasure (or sometimes pain) to see the
result of one’s shot.</p>

<p>In an ideal hole, the turf should be as
perfect as possible and the approaches
should have the same consistency as the
greens, but it is by no means advisable
to avoid entirely bad lies or irregular
stances. There is not only much skill
required, but an improvement of one’s
game results in occasionally having to
play out of a cupped lie, or from an uneven
stance. There are few things more monotonous
than always playing from a dead
flat fairway.</p>

<p>In an ideal long hole, there should not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
only be a big advantage from successfully
negotiating a long carry for the tee shot,
but the longer the drive, the greater the
advantage should be. A shorter driver
should also, by extreme accuracy, be able
to gain an advantage over a long hitting
but less accurate opponent.</p>

<p>An ideal hole should provide an infinite
variety of shots according to the varying
positions of the tee, the situation of the
flag, the direction and strength of the
wind, etc. It should also at times give
full advantage for the voluntary pull or
slice, one of the most finished shots in
golf, and one that few champions are able
to carry out with any great degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p>Should an ideal hole be ideal for the
plus, scratch, or long handicap player?
As players of all handicaps play golf, a
hole should as far as possible be ideal
for all classes. There are many famous
holes, such as the Cardinal, which are by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
no means ideal, as in an ideal hole there
should always be an alternative route
open to the weaker player.</p>

<p>Are there any ideal holes in existence
at the present moment?</p>

<p>I think the eleventh (the short hole
coming in at St. Andrews) may be considered
so. Under certain conditions, it
is extremely difficult for even the best
player that ever breathed, especially if
he is attempting to get a two, but at the
same time an inferior player may get a
four if he plays his own game exceptionally
well. It has been suggested that the
mere fact that it is possible to putt the
whole length is an objection to it. No
doubt the timid golfer can play the hole
in this way, but he will lose strokes by
avoiding risks. Even if an expert putter
holes out in four strokes once in three
times, he can consider himself lucky.
I do not know of a solitary example of
a player achieving success in an important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
match by this means. If a cross bunker
were constructed at this hole, it would
become appreciably diminished in interest
in consequence. The narrow entrance and
the subtle slopes have all the advantages
of a cross bunker without making it impossible
for the long handicap man. These
contentions are borne out by those
attempts that have been made to copy
and improve on the hole by a cross
bunker.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, other ideal short
holes in existence. The seventh and
fourteenth on the Eden Course at St.
Andrews are remarkably fine holes, especially
as they have to a great extent
been artificially created. At the present
moment the gorse in places is somewhat
near both greens, but this can easily
be rectified, and the architect, Mr. H.
S. Colt, was wise in not removing too
many whins in the first instance, as, if
once removed, they cannot be replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Another good example is the eighth
at Moortown (formerly seventeenth, or,
as it is known locally, Gibraltar). Its
length is 170 yards, and it has been entirely
artificially created at the small cost of £35.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus16">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The eighth green at Moortown</span>: 170 yards, entirely
artificial.</p>
</div>

<p>The green has been constructed on a
slight slope. The soil has been removed
from the lower portion of the slope to
make the bunkers and to bank up the
green. The natural slope has been retained
at the entrance to the green, and,
like the eleventh at St. Andrews, it is
these subtle slopes which lead a ball
which has not been correctly hit, into the
adjacent bunkers, and in reality have very
much the same effect as a cross bunker
without the hardship to the long handicap
player.</p>

<p>The hole also shares with the eleventh
at St. Andrews the necessity for an
infinite variety of shots according to varying
conditions of wind, position of flag, etc.
One day it is a comparatively easy pitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
with a mashie, normally it is a straight
iron shot, sometimes a full shot with a
trace of pull is required, and, again, it is
necessary to slice so that one’s ball is
held up against the slope of the hill.</p>

<p>The green is delightfully picturesque.
It is extremely visible against a background
of fir trees—it stands up and
looks at you.</p>

<p>The contrast between the vivid green
of the grass, the dark green of the firs,
the whiteness of the sand, the purple
heather, and a vivid background of
rhododendrons, combined with the natural
appearance and extreme boldness of the
contours, gives one a picture probably
unsurpassed by anything of a similar
kind in nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus17">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Eighth hole, “Gibraltar,” Moortown golf course.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>It is not only a delightful hole to see,
which at any rate appeals subconsciously
to the dullest of minds, but it is equally
delightful to play. It is less difficult than
it appears. You feel you are taking your
life in your hands, and it therefore appeals,
as Mr. Bernard Darwin says, to the
“spirit of adventure”—yet a well-played
shot always gets its due reward.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, ideal two- or three-shot
holes in existence. Some of those
coming in at St. Andrews are almost, but
not quite, perfect.</p>

<p>The sixteenth (Corner of the Dyke) hole
at St. Andrews is almost ideal for its
length (338 yards). It was a particularly
good hole at the time of the guttie ball,
and is so to-day for a short driver, like
the writer.</p>

<p>As in the majority of good holes, it
is the subtlety of the slopes that makes
it so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus18">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The sixteenth hole at St. Andrews.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>The green is tilted up slightly from
right to left, and it would be a better
hole still if the inclination were greater.
It is also guarded by Grant’s and the
Wig Bunkers on the left-hand side, so
that the approach from the right is
easy, as all the slopes assist the players,
and the approach from the left is exceedingly
difficult.</p>

<p>The point about the hole is that it
is so difficult to get into the best position
to approach the green, because of the
proximity of the Principal’s Nose Bunker
to the railway, and the difficulty of placing
one’s tee shot in such a small space with
all the slopes leading to the bunker. On
the other hand, there is a perfectly easy
route free from all risk to the left of the
Principal’s Nose, but the player in all probability
loses a stroke by taking it.</p>

<p>The fourteenth and seventeenth holes
at St. Andrews are excellent holes, full
of dramatic incident in match play.</p>

<p>The fourteenth hole is probably the
best hole of its length in existence. Here,
again, the hole is made by the slope of
the green. There is a most marked tilt
up from left to right, so much so that it
is impossible to approach near the hole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
from the right. It is slopes of this kind
which are so often overlooked in designing
a golf course, and it is one of the
most difficult things imaginable to construct
them really well; but it is subtleties
of this nature which make all the
difference between a good course and a
bad one.</p>

<p>At the fourteenth hole at St. Andrews
this tilt of the green has a considerable
influence on the tee shot 530 yards away.
Some years ago there were four of us
playing four ball matches nearly every
day for a month. We, according to our
own judgment, attempted to play this
hole in four different ways. A played his
tee shot well away to the left of the
Beardies on to the low ground below the
Elysian Fields, so as to place his second
in a favourable position for his approach.
B, who was a long driver, attempted to
carry the Beardies with his drive, Hell
with his second, and run up his third.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
C, who was a short but fairly accurate
hitter, attempted to pinch the Beardies
as near as he dare, and then played his
second well away to the left, so as to
play against the slope of the green for
his third. D took what was apparently the
straightforward route along the large broad
plateau of the Elysian Fields, and eventually
landed in Hell or Perdition every
time: he invariably lost the hole.</p>

<p>This hole is very nearly ideal, but would
be better still if the lie of the land were
such that the Beardies, the Crescent, the
Kitchen, and Hell Bunkers were visible
and impressive looking. If these bunkers
only looked as terrifying and formidable
as they really are, what thrills one would
get in playing this hole! What pleasurable
excitement there would be in seeing one’s
second shot sailing over Hell!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus19">

taken by A, B, C, and D.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>It may be, however, that it is just as
well these bunkers are blind. If they had
been visible, although in reality they would
have been much fairer, there would have
been so many players crying out that it
was most unfair that bunkers should be
placed in the exact position where perfect
shots go; that it was most iniquitous to
have a hazard like the Beardies 180 yards
from the tee exactly in the line for the
hole; that the carry over Hell for the
second shot is over 400 yards from the tee;
and that the only way to play the hole was
along the fairway to the fifth, etc., etc.</p>

<p>As these bunkers are blind, players do
not notice these things, and the lives of
the Green Committee are saved.</p>

<p>The seventeenth hole at St. Andrews is
almost too well known to need description—it
is probably the most noted hole
in the world. Although so difficult, it
is by no means impossible for the long
handicap player, for he can go pottering
along, steering wide of all hazards, and
losing strokes because he refuses to take
any risks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>At this hole, once more, it is the slopes
that give so much character to the hole.</p>

<p>Even for the tee shot there is a ridge
immediately beyond the corner of the
station-master’s garden which kicks your
ball away from the hole if you pitch to
the left of it, and towards the hole if
you pitch to the right—in fact, an extra
yard or two over the corner makes all
the difference in getting into a favourable
position for the second shot. There are
also hillocks and ridges down the right-hand
side, all forcing an inaccurately placed
shot into an unfavourable position for
the approach.</p>

<p>I often think that the hole would be
more interesting without the Scholar’s
Bunker—the latter prevents a badly hit
second getting into the danger zone. If
it were not there, one would much more
frequently be forced to play the sporting
approach to the green with the road
bunker intervening. It is this road bunker,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
with the slopes leading a ball to it, which
makes this hole of such intense interest.
Notwithstanding the abuse showered on
it, this bunker has done more to sustain
the popularity of St. Andrews than any
feature on the course.</p>

<p>During the last few years there have
been many good inland courses constructed.
Several of these, such as Swinley
Forest, St. George’s Hill, Sunningdale,
Alwoodley, Moortown, Ganton, etc., have
some excellent long holes.</p>

<p>At Alwoodley, two of the dog-legged
holes, the eighth and fifteenth, are particularly
good examples. The eighth is
played from right to left and the fifteenth
from left to right. In each case the green
has been constructed with a marked side
slope, so that the nearer the golfer plays to
the angle of the dog-leg, the greater the
slope favours him.</p>

<p>In 1914 the writer designed an ideal
two-shot hole which won the first prize in
a competition for Golfing Architecture,
promoted by <i>Country Life</i>.</p>

<p>In designing it, he attempted to produce
an ideal hole among perfect surroundings,
and what could be more perfect than
sand-dunes by the seashore!</p>

<p>The hole is 420 yards long from the
ordinary and 450 yards from the Medal
Tee.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to produce the
old type of golf, in which a player has no
fixed line to the hole, but has to use his
own judgment in playing it, according to
varying conditions of wind, etc.</p>

<p>The green is guarded by bunkers and
a large hillock (20 feet high) on the right
of the approach, and is also tilted upwards
from left to right and from the front to
the back, so that the approach from the
left is an easy one, and from the right
necessitates such a difficult pitch that the
player is likely to overrun the green into
the bunker beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>There are five possible routes to the
hole, and the choice of the player must
vary from day to day, according to his
length of drive, the state of the weather, etc.</p>

<p>It caters for all classes of players—even
the absolute beginner can take No. 5
line. He loses strokes not by getting into
bunkers, but by avoiding risks, and probably
takes five, or at least four, to reach
the green in consequence; nevertheless
he enjoys his game, and not being disheartened,
he improves, until finally he
may be able to achieve the boldest line
of all, and drive a fine ball straight to
the hole.</p>

<p>He who takes the left-hand road by
way of the island can also get home in
two; he has a shorter carry, but has to
make up for this by extreme accuracy.</p>

<p>There are many positions by the seashore
where a hole of this kind could be
constructed, but it would be possible to
make one of a similar type inland, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
if the subsoil consisted of sand
and the lie of the land was favourable. The
seashore could be replaced by bunkers,
old quarry workings, hummocky ground,
rough, or even land out of bounds.</p>

<p>Success in construction depends entirely
on expert supervision. It is like all successful
golf-course construction, a question
of making the best use of natural features
and the devising of artificial ones, indistinguishable
from nature.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FUTURE OF GOLF ARCHITECTURE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>As the future of Golf Architecture depends
on the prospects of golf, it may be of
interest to discuss the probability of its
abiding popularity.</p>

<p>Golf has been played in Scotland for
several centuries, and there appears to
be no sign of any decreased popularity,
but rather the reverse. The illusiveness
of golf is sufficient to ensure its popularity.
No one ever seems to master it. You
imagine you have got the secret to-day,
but it has gone to-morrow. This is so in
all good games. There are some games,
such as ping-pong and roller-skating,
which become merely passing crazes, and
the reason is that one obtains a certain
standard which neither diminishes nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
increases, and then the game becomes
monotonous. Golf on a first-rate course
can never become monotonous, and the
better the course the less likely it is to do
so. Golf on a good links is, in all probability,
the best game in the world, but
on the late-Victorian type of inland course,
where there is a complete lack of variety,
flat fairways, flat unguarded greens, long
grass, necessitating frequent searching for
lost balls, and mathematically placed
hazards consisting of the cop or pimple
variety, it not only offends all the finest
instincts of the artist and the sportsman,
but is the most boring game in existence.
The advent of the golf architect is rapidly
curing all these disabilities.</p>

<p>A good golf course is a great asset to
the nation. Those who harangue against
land being diverted from agriculture and
used for golf have little sense of proportion.
Comparing the small amount of land
utilised for golf with the large amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely
more value out of the former than the
latter. We all eat too much. During the
Great War the majority were all the fitter
for being rationed and getting a smaller
amount of food, but none of us get enough
fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and
exercise. Health and happiness are everything
in this world. Money-grubbing
(so called business), except in so far as
it helps to attain these, is of minor importance.
One of the reasons why I, “a
medical man,” decided to give up medicine
and take to golf architecture was my
firm conviction of the extraordinary influence
on health of pleasurable excitement,
especially when combined with fresh air
and exercise. How frequently have I,
with great difficulty, persuaded patients
who were never off my doorstep to take up
golf, and how rarely, if ever, have I seen
them in my consulting-rooms again! It
is not suggested that golf is the one and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
only remedy. Men may get equal results
from shooting, fishing, riding, cricket,
tennis, etc., and may even obtain pleasurable
excitement from gardening, politics,
or their own business, but for the majority
of men, golf is the most convenient form
of pleasurable excitement and exercise
to take. Those who rave against golf
courses surely forget that many of the
greatest politicians, thinkers, and business
men conserve their health and their mental
powers through golf. As examples we
could quote President Wilson, Lloyd
George, Carnegie, A. J. Balfour, Asquith,
Winston Churchill, Lord Northcliffe, and
scores of others. I hope to live to see
the day when there are crowds of municipal
courses, as in Scotland, cropping up
all over England. It would help enormously
in increasing the health, the virility,
and the prosperity of the nation,
and would do much to counteract discontent
and Bolshevism. There can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
no possible reason against, and there is
every reason in favour of, municipal
courses. They are all for the good of
the community, and even from a financial
point of view, at the small green fees of
3<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> a round invariably pay.</p>

<p>If this be so that games, and particularly
golf, are of such vital importance to
national health and social content, then
surely the provision of adequate and
proper facilities for golf should be taken
seriously, and in making this provision
the golf architect has a special part.</p>

<p>The test of a good golf architect is
the power of converting bad inland material
into a good course, and not the power of
fashioning excellent seaside material into
a mediocre one.</p>

<p>The majority of amateurs are sportsmen,
and they welcome anything that
increases the sporting element of the game.
There are, on the other hand, others,
including some of our best players, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
look upon golf in the “card and pencil”
spirit, and view with resentment anything
that has stopped their steady series of
threes and fours.</p>

<p>The advent of the golf architect has
done much to increase the sporting and
the dramatic element in golf. The true
test of the value of his work is its popularity,
and judging by the rapid increase
in members, even on the mere rumour
that the services of a well-known course
architect are to be obtained, there can
be no doubt the modern constructor of
courses has achieved this. The writer
knows examples of the reconstruction of
one or two short holes bringing in over
one hundred fresh members to a club which
had been steadily diminishing in numbers
for years.</p>

<p>There are many and varied qualities
required for the making of a successful
golf architect.</p>

<p>In the first place, he must have an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
intimate knowledge of the theory of playing
the game. He need not be himself a
good player. He may have some physical
disability which prevents him becoming
so, but as the training of the golf architect
is purely mental and not physical, this
should not prevent him from being a
successful golf-course architect. In any
case, the possession of a vivid imagination,
which is an absolute essential in obtaining
success, may prevent him attaining a
position among the higher ranks of
players. Every one knows how fatal imagination
is in playing the game. Let
the fear of socketing once enter your
head, and you promptly socket every shot
afterwards.</p>

<p>His knowledge of the game should be
so intimate that he knows instinctively
what is likely to produce good golf and
good golfers. He must have more than
a passing acquaintance with the best
courses and the best golfing holes. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
not only necessary that he should play
them, but study them and analyse the
features which make them what they are.
He must have a sense of proportion and
be able to differentiate between essentials
and non-essentials. He should be able
to distinguish between those features which
are of supreme importance in the making
of a hole and those which are of less
value.</p>

<p>He must have judgment in the choice of
features which can be readily and cheaply
reproduced, and not those which are
impossible to construct without an inordinate
expenditure of labour.</p>

<p>How frequently has one seen hundreds
of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to
reproduce the Alps, the Himalayas, or
the Cardinal! Features of this kind look
absolutely out of place unless the surrounding
ranges of hills which harmonise
with them are also reproduced. To do
this would involve the expenditure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
hundreds of thousands of pounds. How
often are attempts made to copy a hole and
the subtle slopes and undulations which are
the making of the original overlooked!</p>

<p>The golf-course architect must have the
sporting instinct, and if he has had a
training in many and varied branches of
sport, and has analysed those characteristics
which provide a maximum of
pleasurable excitement in them, so much
the better. It is essential that he should
eliminate his own game entirely, and
look upon all constructional work in a
purely impersonal manner.</p>

<p>He should be able to put himself in
the position of the best player that ever
lived, and at the same time be extremely
sympathetic towards the beginner and
long handicap player.</p>

<p>He should, above all, have a sense of
proportion and be able to come to a
prompt decision as to what is the greatest
good to the greatest number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus22">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="700" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The fifth hole at Fulford, Yorks—approximate cost,
£35</span>: the whole of the additional nine holes on this course were
constructed on dead flat land at a total cost of about £300.</p>
</div>

<p>He should not be unduly influenced
by hostile criticism, but should give the
most sympathetic consideration to criticism
of a constructive nature. Not infrequently
a long handicap man makes
a brilliant suggestion which can often be
utilised in a modified form.</p>

<p>A knowledge of psychology gained in
the writer’s medical training has been
of great service in estimating what is
likely to give the greatest pleasure to
the greatest number.</p>

<p>It by no means follows that what
appears to be attractive at first sight will
be permanently so. A good golf course
grows on one like good painting, good
music, etc.</p>

<p>The ideal golf architect should have
made a study, from a golfing point of
view, of agricultural chemistry, botany,
and geology. He should also have some
knowledge of surveying, map-reading, and
the interpretation of aerial photographs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Aerial photography will become of enormous
value in all kinds of surveying,
town-planning, the construction of golf
courses, etc.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of details visible in
an aerial photograph which are often
omitted after the most careful survey in
the ordinary way. The exact positions
of every tree, hummock, natural bunker,
tracks, hedges, ditches, etc., are well
defined. The exact areas occupied by
permanent pasture, grass grown for hay,
crops, clumps of whins, rushes, etc., can all
be distinguished in an aerial photograph.</p>

<p>These, combined with a good ordnance
and geological drift-map, are of
inestimable value, and in many cases
would assist even the most expert golf
architect to make such full use of all the
natural features that thousands of pounds
might ultimately be saved in reducing
the acreage required and in minimising
the cost of labour, upkeep, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>In these days when manual labour
costs so much, it is of supreme importance
to reduce it to a minimum by the substitution
of mental labour.</p>

<p>Golf architecture is a new art closely
allied to that of the artist or the sculptor,
but also necessitating a scientific knowledge
of many other subjects.</p>

<p>In the old days, many golf courses were
designed by prominent players, who after
a preliminary inspection of the course
simply placed pegs to represent the position
of the sites for the suggested tees,
greens, bunkers, etc. The whole thing
was completed in a few hours, and the
best results could hardly have been expected,
and in fact never were obtained,
by these methods.</p>

<p>The modern designer, on the other hand,
is likely to achieve the most perfect
results and make the fullest use of all
the natural features by more up-to-date
methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>After a preliminary inspection or inspections
in the calm and quiet of his
own study with an ordnance map and,
if possible, aeroplane photographs in front
of him, he visualises every feature. He
is then not so likely to be obsessed by
details, but gives everything its due proportionate
value. He then evolves his
scheme and pays a second visit to the
ground, and, if necessary, modifies his
ideas according to the appearance on the
spot.</p>

<p>There is an extraordinary resemblance
between what is now known as the camouflage
of military earthworks and golf-course
construction.</p>

<p>The writer was fortunate during the war
in being asked to give the demonstrations
to members of the Army Council which
were the foundation of, and led to the
establishment of, the first school of camouflage.</p>

<p>These demonstrations were evolved from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
his experience as a golf-course architect
in the imitation of natural features.</p>

<p>Successful golf-course construction and
successful camouflage are almost entirely
due to utilisation of natural features to
the fullest extent and to the construction
of artificial ones indistinguishable from
nature.</p>

<p>It is clear that if a gun emplacement
or any other object of military importance
is made indistinguishable from the most
innocent-looking feature on the landscape,
it will escape the disagreeable attention
of the enemy. And what can appear
more innocent than the natural undulations
of the ground? Therefore in camouflage,
as in golf-course construction, the ability
to imitate natural undulations successfully
is of special importance.</p>

<p>There are many other attributes in
common between the successful golf
architect and the camoufleur.</p>

<p>Both, if not actually artists, must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
an artistic temperament, and have had
an education in science.</p>

<p>Surprise is the most important thing in
war, and by camouflage you are able to
obtain this not only on the defence but
in the attack.</p>

<p>In golf architecture and camouflage a
knowledge of psychology is of enormous
value. It enables one to judge what is
likely to give pleasurable excitement to
the golfer and confidence and improvement
in <i>moral</i> to the soldier. The writer
feels most strongly that his experience
in the Great War in visualising and surveying
miles of sites for fortifications in
this country and abroad, in map-reading,
in the interpretation of aerial photographs,
in drainage and labour-saving
problems, and particularly in the mental
training of strategic camouflage and devising
traps and surprises for the enemy,
was by no means wasted even from a
golf-course point of view. The only man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
he has been successful in initiating rapidly
into the mysteries of golf-course architecture
was not a golfer but an artist, and
one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
of experts on camouflage.</p>

<p>A little knowledge is a specially dangerous
thing in links’ architecture. One
of our greatest troubles in dealing with
the committees of the old-established seaside
courses is that their world-renowned
reputation (not due to any virtue of their
own, but entirely owing to the natural
advantages of their links) makes them
think themselves competent judges of a
golf course.</p>

<p>They ask for a report and plan of suggested
improvements, and then imagine
they have grasped the ideas of the designer,
and proceed to make a horrible hash of
it. I do not know a single seaside course
which has been remodelled in anything
like the way it should have been remodelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>The best artificially constructed seaside
course I know is the Eden (Mr. Colt’s)
Course at St. Andrews. There are few
of the crowds of players who, notwithstanding
its youth, already congregate on
it realise how much is due to artificiality
and how little to nature. All the best
ground at St. Andrews had been previously
seized for the three older courses—viz.,
the Old, the New, and the Jubilee—and
yet it compares favourably with any
of them. This is entirely due to the fact
that not only was it designed by Mr.
Colt, but the construction work was done
by men who had been trained under him
and worked under his supervision.</p>

<p>It is much better that construction
work should be done by men without any
knowledge of the subject than by those
partly trained.</p>

<p>There is a yarn told about two rival
constructors of golf courses: one of them
was admiring the other’s greens, and remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
that “he never managed to get
his green-keeper to make the undulations
as natural looking.” The other replied that
“it was perfectly easy; he simply employed
the biggest fool in the village and told
him to make them flat.”</p>

<p>I believe the real reason St. Andrews
Old Course is infinitely superior to anything
else is owing to the fact that it was constructed
when no one knew anything about
the subject at all, and since then it has
been considered too sacred to be touched.
What a pity it is that the natural advantages
of many seaside courses have been
neutralised by bad designing and construction
work!</p>

<p>The architect is the best judge in deciding
how often he should visit a course for
supervision purposes. How often have I
heard from the secretary, who is almost
invariably a cheery optimist, that the
construction work was going on splendidly,
and when too late discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
hundreds of pounds had been thrown
away in doing bad work which had
ultimately to be scrapped!</p>

<p>There is an old Persian saying:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He who knows not, and knows not that he knows
not, is a fool. Avoid him.</p>

<p>“He who knows not, and knows that he knows not,
will learn. Teach him.</p>

<p>“He who knows, and knows not that he knows, will
fail. Pity him.</p>

<p>“He who knows, and knows that he knows, is a wise
man. Follow him.”</p>

</div>

<p>The majority of committees, being composed
of men who have made their living
out of their brains, are beginning to know
that they know not, and this is all to the
good of the future of golf.</p>

<p>The most backward committees are
those in Scotland, London, and America.
They have not yet realised that golf-course
architecture is a question of mental
and not physical training. It is particularly
strange that my own countrymen,
who have such a wealth of golfing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
material and attach so much importance to
education, attach so little to education
in golf architecture.</p>

<p>The time will surely come, as it has
already done in the North of England, when
committees will attach as much importance
to the architecture of the course as to
that of the club-house.</p>

<p>In time many of the dull, monotonous,
muddy inland London links will be entirely
remodelled under expert supervision,
and the turf and subsoil treated so that
it is a pleasure to play on them even
during the winter months.</p>

<p>The time will also come when even
some of the championship courses will be
entirely remodelled under expert supervision,
and when these clubs will realise
how little they have made of the
natural advantages that Providence has
provided for them.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
